# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are documented here.

## 0.7.0

- Added optional watcher mode: periodic background check of the download
  folder with a notification for new finds (sorting still needs your
  confirmation).
- Added library check: per-system statistics plus detection of misplaced
  ROMs, which can be re-sorted through the normal review flow.
- Butler-flavored empty state and SD-card FAQ in the README.

## 0.6.0

- Added undo for sorted ROMs directly from the log (extracted files are
  removed while the source archive still exists; moved files go back).
- Added per-system folder overrides in Settings for non-ES-DE frontends
  (e.g. `roms/ps1` instead of `roms/psx`).
- Added folder-name detection hints: ambiguous files inside folders like
  `SNES/` or `PS2/` now get a "probable" suggestion.
- Added a local, privacy-friendly crash report that can be shared manually.
- Review list now sorts items needing decisions first and shows a
  confidence color legend.
- Added a battery-optimization shortcut in Settings for long sorting runs.

## 0.5.0

- Added 8 systems: Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, Sega 32X,
  Neo Geo Pocket (Color), WonderSwan (Color).
- Added "create new folder" inside the folder picker.
- Added opt-in automatic update check on app start (badge on the settings icon).

- Notification permission is now also requested on the review screen for
  existing installations.
- Updated the empty-scan hint to mention loose ROM files.
